5. When you make a call to one of the pages generated by 1 and 2 above, 
the call will arrive at the web server first. List in a bullet point format
all the files that will be processed in the order they will be processed in 
before the web server responds to the client. 

ans\
-the web server creates a thread to handle the request, and it get back to listening.

-the new thread will understand the request, and start processing.

-the thread will realize this is a resource that is handle by the application server ,
 and hands the request to the port it is listening on.

-application server will hand that request to a new thread.

-the new thread will understand the request, and start processing.

-thread will initialize all resources that your application will use such as database
 connection,mail server connections.

-thread will determine which methoud to call inside your code based on the request,
 and it will package the parameters as call parameters to the method.
 
-your code will process the business logic inside the method.

- you will have to connect to the database to save data.

-your data, as will as the commands for database will be converted from your specific
 language to language(text) that operating system understands(marshalling).

-the operating system will take the information from the application server port,
 reads where it need to go, then puts it through the port of destination.

-database will convert the information that came through to a language it understands
 (SQL)

-database thread will excute the statment, then returns an answer to the operating
 system will understand.

-operating system will take the information and places it through the port of the 
 application server thread.

-thread unmarshalls the information back in to the specific language, and sends the
 result back to the calling method in your code.

-thread will create an HTML/CSS/Javascript page that will nclude the result of processing
 your business logic.

-thread will apply some compression, combination, and packing of code before sending 
 back to the web servers calling thread as a HTTP/HTTPS response

-the web server calling thread will send the information back to the calling client.
